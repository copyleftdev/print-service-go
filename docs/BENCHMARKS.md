## Historical Performance Trends

### Test Suite Evolution

| Version | Test Cases | Duration | Throughput | Notes |
|---------|------------|----------|------------|-------|
| Basic | 6 | <1s | N/A | Initial implementation |
| Enhanced | 30 | <5s | ~10 tests/sec | Added edge cases |
| True Rigor | 1,537 | ~3min | ~8 tests/sec | Production validation |
| Ultra Rigor | 23,090 | 46.9s | 687 tests/sec | Boundary exploration |

### Performance Improvements

1. **Cycle Detection**: Eliminated infinite loops in HTML parsing
2. **Concurrent Processing**: Improved throughput through parallelization
3. **Memory Optimization**: Reduced memory footprint per test case
4. **Graceful Fallback**: Prevented blocking on service errors

## Benchmarking Guidelines

### Running Benchmarks

```bash
# Run performance benchmarks
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./internal/tests/golden/

# Run with CPU profiling
go test -bench=. -cpuprofile=cpu.prof ./internal/tests/golden/

# Run with memory profiling
go test -bench=. -memprofile=mem.prof ./internal/tests/golden/

# Generate benchmark comparison
go test -bench=. -count=5 ./internal/tests/golden/ | tee benchmark.txt
```

### Interpreting Results

- **tests/sec**: Higher is better for throughput
- **Memory allocations**: Lower is better for efficiency
- **Duration consistency**: Lower variance indicates stability
- **Error rates**: Should remain constant across runs

### Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Ultra Rigor Throughput | >500 tests/sec | 687 tests/sec | ✅ |
| Memory Stability | No leaks | Stable | ✅ |
| Zero Crashes | 100% | 100% | ✅ |
| Graceful Degradation | >95% | 100% | ✅ |

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

- **CPU**: 2 cores, 2.0 GHz
- **Memory**: 4 GB RAM
- **Storage**: 1 GB available space
- **Go Version**: 1.21+

### Recommended for Ultra Rigor

- **CPU**: 4+ cores, 3.0+ GHz
- **Memory**: 8+ GB RAM
- **Storage**: 2+ GB available space
- **SSD**: For faster I/O during test data generation

## Optimization Tips

### For Development

1. Use `-short` flag for faster test cycles
2. Run specific test suites instead of full ultra rigor
3. Use `-timeout` to prevent hanging tests
4. Monitor memory usage during development

### For CI/CD

1. Run ultra rigor tests on dedicated hardware
2. Use parallel test execution where possible
3. Cache test data generation results
4. Set appropriate timeouts for different test levels

### For Production Validation

1. Run full ultra rigor suite before releases
2. Monitor performance regression between versions
3. Track memory usage trends over time
4. Validate throughput under production load
